Example of using `vite-plugin-ssr` with Vue Router.

This example completely replaces `vite-plugin-ssr`'s built-in router with Vue Router. Alternatively we can:
 - Use Vue Router only for a single or a couple pages.
 - Deeply integrate Vue Router with `vite-plugin-ssr`'s router. (:construction: Work-in-progress: follow this [ticket](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/issues/9) and see this [PR](https://github.com/brillout/vite-plugin-ssr/pull/40).)

To run it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:brillout/vite-plugin-ssr
cd vite-plugin-ssr/examples/vue-router/
npm install
npm run start
```
